  <h2><span>What went down:</span></h2>
  <p>
    <span>In week 13 of November 18 - November 24, I used the same spore game, and used arrays to make all the random objects.</span>
    <span><br>For the discussion I talked about how I've developed over the semester. (I enjoy coding even more now, and I want to apply what I've learned to a big side project!)</span>

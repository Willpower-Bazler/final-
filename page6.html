<h1><span>Weeks 6, 7, and 8</span></h1>

  <h2><span>What went down:</span></h2>
  <p>
      <span>In week 6 of September 30 - October 6, I created the first 3-page website using basic HTML</span>
      <span><br>I also talked about my favorite websites.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about how we still need websites, especially with all the social media.</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>In week 7 of October 7 - October 13, I used the 3-page website and added some style to it using CSS.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about the "eye of the beholder", and what I would do if I was having issues with a client.</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>In week 8 of October 14 - October 20, I used the same 3-page website and incorporated Javascript. I also made a simple math game, also using Javascript.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about privacy vs. convenience.</span>

  </p>

<span><br>The completed website and math game after weeks 6, 7, and 8! </span>

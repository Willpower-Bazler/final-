<h1><span>Weeks 11 and 12</span></h1>

  <h2><span>What went down:</span></h2>
  <p>
      <span>In week 11 of November 4 - November 10, I created a spore game using p5js.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about how it justifiable to use other people's work if it is for inspiration, or to use as a starting point rather than from scratch.</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>In week 12 of November 11 - November 17, I used the spore game, and organized it and made it more efficient by using functions.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about programming culture and how it is interestingly male dominated. Heavily.</span>

  </p>

<span><br>The spore game after week 12, all decked out with functions!</span>

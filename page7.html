<h1><span>Weeks 9 and 10</span></h1>

  <h2><span>What went down:</span></h2>
  <p>
      <span>In week 9 of October 21 - October 27, I created a "self portrait" using p5js.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about how the majority of the time code is a tool for creating art, just as a camera is a tool for creating movies. (Art.)</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span>In week 10 of October 28 - November 3, I used the same "self-portrait" and made random objects move.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about the relationship between art and gaming, and how they can't go without each other.</span>
      <br>

<h1><span>Week 4</span></h1>

  <h2><span>What went down:</span></h2>
  <p>
      <span>In week 4 of September 16 - September 22, I uploaded a short paper on a big influencer in my life. (Mom of course.) </span>
      <span><br>I made an actual game using Scratch, and had my family play it Mom, Dad, and 3 younger brothers.</span>
      <span><br>I made a silly app and had my Dad try it out.</span>
      <span><br>For the discussion I talked about how mobile phones are a good thing, but humans just can't use them properly and it's leading to mass depression, anxiety, etc.</span>
